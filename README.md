# Code Snippets to be Proud of

> The Above code is pretty simple but it made things so much simpler for us. By doing that we were able to keep the ```welcome page``` looking great without having to sacrifice the privacy and perks of being a user. By doing that we can keep all the links visible on the welcome page and once clicked on, it redirects the user to ```login``` if not yet logged in. The simplest way to do it proved to be the best one!
